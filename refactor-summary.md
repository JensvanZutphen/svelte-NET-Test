# Login and Register Pages Refactoring - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Server Files with Form Actions

**Login Page Server File** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(auth)/login/+page.server.ts`):
- Implemented form actions for handling login submissions
- Added server-side validation for required fields
- Integrated with existing backend API using the generated SDK
- Set authentication token in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Added proper error handling with `fail()` and redirection with `redirect()`

**Register Page Server File** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(auth)/register/+page.server.ts`):
- Implemented form actions for handling registration submissions
- Added server-side validation for required fields
- Integrated with existing backend API using the generated SDK
- Set authentication token in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Added proper error handling with `fail()` and redirection with `redirect()`

### 2. Updated Svelte Components

**Login Page Component** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(auth)/login/+page.svelte`):
- Converted from client-side form handling to server-side form actions
- Added `use:enhance` for progressive enhancement
- Preserved form values after failed submissions
- Displayed server-side validation errors
- Simplified component logic by removing client-side state management

**Register Page Component** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(auth)/register/+page.svelte`):
- Converted from client-side form handling to server-side form actions
- Added `use:enhance` for progressive enhancement
- Preserved form values after failed submissions
- Displayed server-side validation errors
- Simplified component logic by removing client-side state management

### 3. Updated Authentication Service

**Auth Service** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/api/authService.ts`):
- Modified to work with server-side cookie management
- Removed localStorage dependency for token storage
- Maintained compatibility with existing API client code

### 4. Updated Layout Server Files

**App Layout Server** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts`):
- Updated to check authentication status using cookies
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login page

**Auth Layout Server** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(auth)/+layout.server.ts`):
- Updated to check authentication status using cookies
- Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Security**: Using HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage for JWT tokens prevents XSS attacks
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms work even without JavaScript enabled
3. **Server-Side Validation**: Form validation happens on the server for better security
4. **Better Error Handling**: Proper error states with preserved form data
5. **SvelteKit Best Practices**: Following the recommended form actions pattern
6. **Improved UX**: Better loading states and error messaging through progressive enhancement

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Try submitting without filling fields (should show validation errors)
   - Try with invalid credentials (should show error message)
   - Try with valid credentials (should redirect to `/pokemon`)

2. **Register Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/register`
   - Try submitting without filling fields (should show validation errors)
   - Try with valid information (should create account and redirect to `/pokemon`)

3. **Authentication Protection**:
   - Try accessing protected routes without authentication (should redirect to login)
   - Try accessing login/register pages when already authenticated (should redirect to home)

4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Test forms with JavaScript disabled (should still work but with full page reloads)
   - Test forms with JavaScript enabled (should work with enhanced UX)
