# Logout Feature Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dedicated Logout Page

**Logout Page Server File** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(app)/logout/+page.server.ts`):
- Implemented a logout form action that deletes the authToken cookie
- Added proper redirection to the login page after logout

### 2. Updated App Layout Component

**App Layout Component** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte`):
- Added a logout form with a submit button in the navigation bar
- Used the SvelteKit form action pattern with `action="/logout"`

### 3. Restored App Layout Server File

**App Layout Server File** (`MySvelteApp.Client/src/routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts`):
- Removed the invalid actions export
- Kept only the authentication check logic

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks the "Logout" link in the navigation bar, it submits a POST request to the `/logout` page
2. The server-side logout action deletes the authToken cookie
3. The user is redirected to the login page

## Benefits

1. **Secure**: Properly deletes the authentication cookie
2. **Simple**: Uses SvelteKit's built-in form action pattern
3. **Accessible**: Works with or without JavaScript
4. **User-Friendly**: Provides a clear way to end the session
